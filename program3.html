        <p class="text-justify">
        Bangladesh is a developing country. Here, a vast number of people are not aware of their duties, responsibilities and rights and therefore they cannot experience individual independence and better life as they should have. The question is: How and where from they become concerned about it. According to Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), there are about 41 million households/family are living in this country (HIES 2022) and most of these families do not have the ability to provide education and necessary socialization opportunity to their children. Thus, the only place where the children in Bangladesh actively learn norms, values, and behaviors in the schools, which shapes their attitudes and prepare them for Bangladesh. Unfortunate, the irresponsibility, corruptions, lack proper educational management, poor course curriculum and many untrained teachers in the schools/college/university can hardly provide good education to the children to build up them properly for the country. Though people are spending much money for their childrenâ€™s education, it does not function properly due to the poor education system of Bangladesh. However, the people are not aware of this fact that the children are not educated properly for their future by the system. They are not raising their voice against the pitfalls in the education system.

Mainly the lack of accountability of the governing authorities has made this scenario in the country. Anyway, the citizens of the country need to raise their voice against the poor education system to reform it. On the other hand, the economy of a country grows faster when the social systems are strong enough due to required knowledge and skills of the people. People living in a country must have the mindset and ability to cope up with the right process of development. Thus, a government should take initiatives to develop proper human resources for the necessary development projects. When honesty and other moral values of the people in the society i. e. , the public integrity and personality is strong enough, their actions, thinking, opinions become standard to play the proper role for sustainable development of the country. However, it is significantly necessary to construct appropriate public integrity and personality through proper education system in Bangladesh. Therefore, to shape the mindset of our people Community Education and Research Network, Bangladesh (CERN BD) conducts the Self- Education Program (SELP).
