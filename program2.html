      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Introduction:</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">
There are thousands of schools and madrasa in Bangladesh where a huge number of students
are studying in science. Among these a very few schools are government laboratory schools.
Mainly the secondary education is maintained by non-government schools and madrasa. In
many schools the class size is very large to teach properly for a teacher. Most of the schools
do not have required well trained and skillful science teachers, science experiment labs and
good governance system to keep standard of education, especially in the rural areas. Poor
funding for the schools and madrasas, lower salary of the teachers, recruitment of unqualified
teachers, inefficient governing body etc. have made the situation very worse. In addition, the
education system of Bangladesh had to go under experimentation by different governments
without considering the contextual feasibility and the needs of the people. Still the education
system has not been modernized and developed yet enough. This has made the educational
system too weak to produce honest, committed and patriotic scholars. Thus, to face this
challenge a proper contextual education system is very necessary to build up the qualified
human resources in the fields of science.
As the traditional classroom teaching method provides enough information to the students
passively and they memorize from textbooks are not able to understand and use their
knowledge to solve real life problems. In order to improve the students’ curiosity,
engagement and understanding hands on practice of the science experiments in the textbooks
is very important. This is why our team under the support of Physics and Science Education
(PSE) laboratory in the department of physics at Jahangirnagar University is dedicated to run
the Science Education Program (SEP) to empower the students to explore and engage in the
world of science through critical and analytical thinking to face our challenges.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Objectives:</h2>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>To provide theoretical knowledge/science concepts among the students through interactive lectures.</li>
        <li>To demonstrate the experiments actively by well-trained university students.</li>
        <li>To teach the school students how to write science experiment/science project reports.</li>
        <li>To assess the performance of the students.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Methodology:</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">
1) Primarily the necessary number of brilliant university students of physics/ chemistry/
mathematics/ biology are being trained up by Professor Sikder’s team under
Teachers’ Training Course (TTC) work for the SEP team. This course work includes
different teaching/ learning maxims and research methods for instance, qualitative,
quantitative and mixed methods along with statistical data analysis techniques.
2) In order to attain the objectives of the SEP, lesson plan is being prepared properly
using inquiry method of learning and teaching.
3) Required theoretical knowledge is provided to the students with enough explanation
before each experiment to understand of the scientific principles.
4) The designed experiments are conducted by the school students for their hands-on
experience to observe the science principles. This is assisted by the SEP team.
5) Assessment of each group students participated for an experiment is performed
through interview/ questionnaires.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Teacher Training Course (TTC) and Human Resource Development (HRD):</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">
1) Required number of interested and academically sound university students of sciences
(Physics/chemistry/mathematics/biology) are selected to train up for the SEP.
2) TTC program of 10-12 weeks is conducted for the university students to introduce
required teaching maxims (especially inquiry method of learning &amp; teaching and
research methods for data analysis) and code of conducts to perform the SEP in
different schools.
3) The trained university students need to make lesson plans and manuals to assist
school students to observe science principles through experiments.
4) A typical example of required manpower for 4 groups of students in a school is given
below.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">The Management Policy of the SEP:</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">
1) Primarily, in order to conduct the SEP, the PSE lab and/or a school can make contact
with each other. It needs a signed agreement in a prescribed form for a period of time
between the SEP team and the school where the SEP will be conducted.
2) The school need to provide lab resources available there for the SEP. (For instance,
pen and papers, required lab space/class room etc.)
3) A science teacher (as external evaluator) of the school needs to assess the SEP how it
is beneficial for their students and the performance of the SEP team members in a
prescribed form for research data (no information should be missed) without any
condition or claiming any payment.

4) A member of the SEP team needs to assess the program and the performance of the
SEP team members who actively help the school students in a prescribed form for
research data.
5) The SEP team needs to arrange required resources for the school students’ hands-on
experiments if the school does not have any resource. However, the required space
should be available in the school.
6) The SEP team is happy to share intellectual property with proper appreciation and
acknowledgement or under an agreement with the schools.
7) No party can harm and/or damage each-others property/ equipment. The SEP team
does not make any payment to any school for the program.
8) The SEP team or the school can cancel the program for an unavoidable inconvenience
circumstance. However, prior notification is required.
9) The SEP team will not conduct any program in any school where there is a security
issue.
10) The typical time for the SEP is approximately two (2) hours. The steps and required
time are framed out in the table below. The required schedule for the SEP will be
maintained by the team.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Students’ Assessment Data Analysis and PSE lab Research:</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">
The students who participate in the SEP are assessed through interview/ questionnaires/ focus
group discussions [based on four categories: i) Students assisted through lecture,
demonstration and manual, ii) Students assisted through demonstration and manual, iii)
students assisted through manual only for individual execution of the experiment and iv)
students who designs and executes his own project/idea] which is the primary data for the
research. The SEP team under the Physics and Science Education laboratory perform
research using these data to upgrade the SEP services in the schools to make the program
more effective and to produce honest, committed and patriotic scientists for the sustainable
development of Bangladesh.
