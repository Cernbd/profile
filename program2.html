    <section>
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Introduction:</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">
There are thousands of schools and madrasa in Bangladesh where a huge number of students are studying in science group. Among these a very few schools are government laboratory schools. Mainly the secondary education is maintained by non-government schools and madrasa. In many schools the class size is very large to teach properly for a teacher. Most of the schools do not have required well trained and skillful science teachers, science experiment labs and good governance system to keep standard of education, especially in the rural areas. Poor funding for the schools and madrasas, lower salary of the teachers, recruitment of unqualified teachers, inefficient governing body etc. have made the situation very worse. In addition, the education system of Bangladesh had to go under experimentation by different governments without considering the contextual feasibility and the needs of the

people. Still the education system has not been modernized and developed yet enough. This has made the educational system too weak to produce honest, committed and patriotic scholars. Thus, to face this challenge a proper contextual education system is very necessary to build up the qualified human resources in the fields of science. As the traditional classroom teaching method provides enough information to the students passively and they memorize from textbooks are not able to understand and use their knowledge to solve real life problems. In order to improve the students’ curiosity, engagement and understanding hands on practice of the science experiments in the textbooks is very important. This is why our team under the support of Physics and Science Education (PSE) laboratory in the Department of Physics at Jahangirnagar University is dedicated to run the Science Education Program (SEP) to empower the students to explore and engage in the world of science through critical and analytical thinking to face our challenges.

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Objectives:</h2>
      <p>In order to produce pragmatic results according to the vision of Professor Sikder’s team, the action plan is to arrange biweekly hands-on science experiments (in the textbook) program for school students to illustrate core scientific principles.

The followings are the objectives of the SEP.

</p> <br>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2">
        <li>To provide theoretical knowledge/science concepts among the students through interactive lectures.</li>
        <li>To demonstrate the experiments actively by well-trained university students.</li>
        <li>To teach the school students how to write science experiment/science project reports.</li>
        <li>To assess the performance of the students.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Methodology:</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">
1) Primarily the necessary number of brilliant university students of physics/ chemistry/ mathematics/ biology are being trained up by Professor Sikder’s team under Teachers’ Training Course (TTC) work for the SEP team. This course work includes different teaching/ learning maxims and research methods for instance, qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods along with statistical data analysis techniques. 
2) In order to attain the objectives of the SEP, lesson plan is being prepared properly using inquiry method of learning and teaching.
3) Required theoretical knowledge is provided to the students with enough explanation before each experiment to understand of the scientific principles. 
4) The designed experiments are conducted by the school students for their hands-on experience to observe the science principles. This is assisted by the SEP team. 
5) Assessment of each group students participated for an experiment is performed through interview/ questionnaires.

    <section>
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">The Management Policy of the SEP:</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">
1) Primarily, in order to conduct the SEP, the PSE lab and/or a school can make contact with each other. It needs a signed agreement in a prescribed form for a period of time between the SEP team and the school where the SEP will be conducted.
2) The school need to provide lab resources available there for the SEP. (For instance, pen and papers, required lab space/class room etc.)
3) A science teacher (as external evaluator) of the school needs to assess the SEP how it is beneficial for their students and the performance of the SEP team members in a prescribed form for research data (no information should be missed) without any condition or claiming any payment.

4) A member of the SEP team needs to assess the program and the performance of the SEP team members who actively help the school students in a prescribed form for research data.
5) The SEP team needs to arrange required resources for the school students’ hands-on experiments if the school does not have any resource. However, the required space should be available in the school.
6) The SEP team is happy to share intellectual property with proper appreciation and acknowledgement or under an agreement with the schools.
7) No party can harm and/or damage each-others property/ equipment. The SEP team does not make any payment to any school for the program.
8) The SEP team or the school can cancel the program for an unavoidable inconvenience circumstance. However, prior notification is required.
9) The SEP team will not conduct any program in any school where there is a security issue.
10) The typical time for the SEP is approximately two (2) hours. The steps and required time are framed out in the table below. The required schedule for the SEP will be maintained by the team.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Students’ Assessment Data Analysis and PSE lab Research:</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">
The students who participate in the SEP are assessed through interview/ questionnaires/ focus group discussions [based on four categories: i) Students assisted through lecture, demonstration and manual, ii) Students assisted through demonstration and manual, iii) students assisted through manual only for individual execution of the experiment and iv) students who designs and executes his own project/idea] which is the primary data for the

research. The SEP team under the Physics and Science Education laboratory perform research using these data to upgrade the SEP services in the schools to make the program more effective and to produce honest, committed and patriotic scientists for the sustainable development of Bangladesh.

  <p><strong>Internal process:</strong> This donation is made directly through a bank account number to arrange the SEP for community schooling. The SEP team takes initiatives to arrange SEP in different schools. An internal audit is performed in this process to ensure the proper use of the funds for the program. Anyone can see the report through proper procedure. The possible funding types are as below:</p>
  <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1">
    <li>Personal donations</li>
    <li>Agency/Business group/Organizational donations</li>
    <li>Crowdfunding</li>
