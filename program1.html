      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">
        Bangladesh is a small and very densely populated country. This large population makes
        challenges to maintain different systems of the country properly. The education system is
        very necessary to build up the qualified human resources for Bangladesh. However, the
        education system of Bangladesh is being experimented many times after it’s liberation in
        1971 without considering the contextual feasibility and the needs of the people. This has
        made the educational system too weak to produce honest, committed and patriotic scholars
        who will serve the country properly. The current classroom teaching methods provides
        enough information to the students in the schools passively. Many schools cannot maintain
        proper educational standards and environment without having required funding and expert
        teachers to teach the students. The students memorize from the textbooks and learn
        something for good grades and certificates. They cannot use their knowledge to solve real life
        problems due to lack of proper understanding. The behavior, critical and analytical thinking
        of the students are not being shaped in the schools for the betterment of the community.
        Hence to improve the students’ understanding proper teaching methodology is very
        important. The inquiry method could be one of the most relevant teaching method applicable
        in our schools. For this purpose, Community Education Program (CEP) is working to
        improve the students’ critical and analytical thinking through proper understanding such that
        the students can apply their knowledge properly in real life, under the leadership of Professor
        Dr. Md. Kabir Uddin Sikder, Physics and Science Education (PSE) laboratory, Department
        of Physics, Jahangirnagar University.

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">
        The CEP provides five-day textbook teaching in a week at the CERN center using inquiry
        method mainly for the secondary school students in the community based on it’s vision. The
        followings are being aimed through the CEP.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
        <li>To provide proper concepts and understanding to the students based on the syllabus of the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) of Bangladesh.</li>
        <li>To demonstrate the experiments actively by well-trained undergraduate/graduate students.</li>
        <li>To teach and practice the students for better communication through listening, speaking, reading and writing.</li>

      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-3">
        <li>University students of physics/chemistry/mathematics/biology are being trained up for Teaching Assistantship by a course work under TTC (Teachers’ Training Course) program. This course work includes different teaching/learning maxims and research methods along with statistical data analysis techniques.</li>
        <li>Qualified students in TTC program are recruited as the teaching assistants (TAs) for the CEP and standard lesson plans are being prepared by the TAs properly using inquiry method [The inquiry method of learning is a student-centered education approach which encourages the learners to explore, investigate, and ask questions to understand the subject matters. In this method the students actively engage in the learning process by posing questions, conducting experiments, and using critical and analytical thinking instead of receiving information and/or answers of the questions from a teacher passively].</li>
        <li>Weekly Five-Day schooling is conducted based on NCTB syllabus for secondary school students.</li>
        <li>Designed experiments are performed by the students assisted by the trained university students for their hands-on experience to observations.</li>
        <li>Assessment of students are carried out by standard testing processes through MCQ and creative questionnaires and interview.</li>

        <li>Required number of interested and academically sound university students (Physics/chemistry/mathematics/biology/Bangla/English/Social Science) are selected to train up for the CEP.</li>
        <li>TTC program of 10/12 weeks is conducted for the university students to introduce required teaching maxims (especially inquiry method of learning & teaching and research methods for data analysis) and code of conducts to perform the CEP.</li>

        <li>Interested secondary students are enrolled at the CERN center to participate in CEP schooling regularly for three hours (normally from 4.00 pm to 7.00 pm).</li>
        <li>A weekly MCQ examination is taken on every Sunday before starting the schooling and a biweekly written examination is conducted regularly.</li>
        <li>A well-organized team monitors the teaching and assessment system very carefully.</li>
        <li>The required data for research is collected from the examinations, hands-on experiments and other relevant activities (say regular guardian interactions) of the CEP.</li>

        Internal process: This donation is deposited directly through a bank account number to help
        the CEP for the poor/underprivileged students. An internal audit is performed in this process
        to ensure the proper use of the funds for the program. Anyone can see the report through
        proper procedure. The followings are supported for the funding of the CEP.

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line mb-4">
        External process: The required logistic support for the CEP could be arranged externally by
        any individual/group. The CEP team provides necessary budget of the expenditure and
        intellectual support for the program but do not handle any cash. In this process donation is
        not deposited in the bank account for the CEP but the documentation is maintained internally.

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li>University students get training for future teaching and contributions in the education system. Their volunteering provides feedback to the community as the education system is paid by income tax and social investments by the people.</li>
        <li>It increases the critical and analytical thinking, and understanding of the students for problem solving skills.</li>
        <li>Especially the poor families in the community are being benefited to educate their children.</li>
